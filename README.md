Started reading refactoring-ui, making notes of important points and solving exercises.

# Design the feature and not the layout

Your designs should be based on feature-first approach and not on layout.

The author says, build the functional part first and then worry about Navs, and headers, and footers.

# Design in GrayScale

Delegate the color induction part for later time. When you design in gray-scale, you're forced to rely on the highlights, and contrasts and spacing to do all the hard-lifting.

This will make the design sound and you can throw in a bunch of colors later.

# Choose a personality

Choose fonts and colors according to your website's personality.

- For a bank application (or a classic app) a straight edged **serif font** would feel great.
- For a new startup a playful more _rounded_ font (any rounded sans serif) would look nice.
- Or you can use a neutral sans serif font if you want your other element to deliver the personality.

Same goes for color, there are many color psycology on the internet but the author tells that the design boils down to how you _feel_ about the color.

- Blue is safe and familiar
- Gold might say expensive and familiar
- Pink is fun and not so serious

> it can be helpful to think about when you’re trying to understand why you think a color is the right fit.

# Border Radius

- Small: No personality and can blend in anywhere
- Large: Feels more playful
- No Border-Radius: This sounds more serious

> Whatever you choose, it’s important to stay consistent. Mixing square corners with rounded corners in the same interface almost always looks worse than sticking with one or the other.

# Limit your choices

The idea that there are 1000s of fonts and colors to choose from might sound like you have the freedom to choose from whatever you want.

However, this is often a paralysing cause.

When you're designing without constraints the decision-making is torture because there can always be more than one right choice.

## Define systems in advanced

Rather than picking a color at a time when needed, define the color-palette and shades of each color ahead of time.

Similarly, don't tweak the font-size one pixel at a time. Define the type-face and font-colors ahead of time, and stick to it.
